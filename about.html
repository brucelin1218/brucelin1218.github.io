<p>Currently I am a senior student of Software Engineering at San Jos√© State University.</p>

<p>I TA CS146, Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms, and do research in optimizing the load balancer in the servers with deep learning.</p>

<p>Besides computer science and software engineering, I enjoy putting some latte art on the coffee, playing my guitar, climbing on rocks, taking some pictures, and several outdoors.</p>
