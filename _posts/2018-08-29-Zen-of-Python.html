<p>As Machine Learning is gettting more popular these years, python becomes the "hot" language that many people wants to master at. This semester I finally start the class that I've been thinking to take - </p> 
<blockquote class="blockquote">Intro to Artificial Intelligence.</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention, knowing Python is the requirement. Before I share the basics of Python language, the first thing I learned about Python was pretty interesting - Zen of Python</p>

<p>Zen of Python is written by Tim Peters in 1999. It is a collection of 20 software priciples that deeply influence the design of the Python language. However, only 19 of them were written down. The fun thing about it was that it was a "easter egg" command line in the Python interpreter.</p>

<p>You can open your Python terminal and simply type:</p>

{% highlight ruby%}
>>> import this
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You should be able to see:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
Beautiful is better than ugly.</br>
Explicit is better than implicit.</br>
Simple is better than complex.</br>
Complex is better than complicated.</br>
Flat is better than nested.</br>
Sparse is better than dense.</br>
Readability counts.</br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</br>
Although practicality beats purity.</br>
Errors should never pass silently.</br>
Unless explicitly silenced.</br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</br>
Now is better than never.</br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.</br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</br>
</blockquote>

<p>Full of wisdom. It applies to our life too.</p>
